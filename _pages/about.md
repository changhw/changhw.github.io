Education
======
* 2013-2017, Zhejiang University, Bachelor of Science (Physics);
* 2017-2022, Zhejiang University, Doctorate of Science (Plasma Physics);

Research
======
* Module development and acceleration of the CLT & CLT-K code
    - Application of the cut-cell boundary handling method at the CLT code;
    - Development of the RMP module of the EAST & HL-2A Tokamaks at the CLT code;
    - Acceleration of the CLT & CLT-K code using the multiple MPI communication domains + OpenACC technologies;
    - Finished the parallel tests of the CLT-K code for 100,000-core at the Tianhe-2 supercomputer (parallel efficiency > 70%) and 200,000-core at the Sugon prototype (parallel efficiency > 60%).
* Simulation studies of the RMP physics in Tokamaks
    - Verification of the RMP module in the CLT code in comparison with the MARS-F code;
    - Numerically studied the penetration properties of RMP in EAST Tokamak;
    - Discussed the importance of toroidicity, toroidal rotation, and nonlinearity in the RMP penetration processes.
* Nonlinear interaction of EPs with tearing mode (TM) and toroidal Alfvén eigenmode (TAE)
    - Investigated the influence of EPs on the linear stabilities of TM;
    - Studied the generation mechanisms of the zonal flow and the TAE due to the redistribution of EPs by the TM.
