Research
======
1. Module development and acceleration of the CLT & CLT-K code
1.1 Application of the cut-cell boundary handling method at the CLT code;
1.2 Development of the RMP module of the EAST & HL-2A Tokamaks at the CLT code;
1.3 Acceleration of the CLT & CLT-K code using the multiple MPI communication domains + OpenACC technologies;
1.4 Finished the parallel tests of the CLT-K code for 100,000-core at the Tianhe-2 supercomputer (parallel efficiency > 70%) and 200,000-core at the Sugon prototype (parallel efficiency > 60%).
2. Simulation studies of the RMP physics in Tokamaks
2.1 Verification of the RMP module in the CLT code in comparison with the MARS-F code;
2.2 Numerically studied the penetration properties of RMP in EAST Tokamak;
2.3 Discussed the importance of toroidicity, toroidal rotation, and nonlinearity in the RMP penetration processes.
3. Nonlinear interaction of EPs with tearing mode (TM) and toroidal Alfvén eigenmode (TAE)
3.1 Investigated the influence of EPs on the linear stabilities of TM;
3.2 Studied the generation mechanisms of the zonal flow and the TAE due to the redistribution of EPs by the TM.
