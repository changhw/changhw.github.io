Research
---
* Module development and acceleration of the CLT & CLT-K code
    - Application of the cut-cell boundary handling method in the CLT code;
    - Development of the resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) module of the EAST & HL-2A Tokamaks in the CLT code;
    - Development and validation of pressure coupling schemes in the CLT-K code;
    - Acceleration of the CLT & CLT-K code using the multiple MPI communication domains + OpenACC technologies;
    - Finished the parallel tests of the CLT-K code for 100,000-core at the Tianhe-2 supercomputer (parallel efficiency > 70%) and 200,000-core at the Sugon prototype (parallel efficiency > 60%).
* Simulation studies of the RMP physics in Tokamaks
    - Verification of the RMP module in the CLT code in comparison with the MARS-F code;
    - Numerically studied the penetration properties of RMP in EAST Tokamak;
    - Discussed the importance of toroidicity, toroidal rotation, and nonlinearity in the RMP penetration processes.
* Nonlinear interaction of energetic particles (EPs) with tearing mode and toroidal Alfvén eigenmode (TAE)
    - Investigated the influence of EPs on the linear stabilities of tearing mode;
    - Studied the generation mechanisms of the zonal flow and the TAE due to the redistribution of EPs by the tearing mode.
* Flux pumping and sawtooth modelling
    - Investigating the flux pumping and sawtoothing discharges for ASDEX-Upgrade tokamak;
