In this paper, the OpenACC heterogeneous parallel programming model is successfully applied to modification and acceleration of the three-dimensional Tokamak magnetohydrodynamical code (CLT). Through combination of OpenACC and MPI technologies, CLT is further parallelised by using multiple-GPUs. Significant speedup ratios are achieved on NVIDIA TITAN Xp and TITAN V GPUs, respectively, with very few modifications of CLT. Furthermore, the validity of the double precision calculations on the above-mentioned two graphics cards has also been strictly verified with m/n = 2/1 resistive tearing mode instability in Tokamak.
